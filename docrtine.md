The Strategic Compendium: A Doctrinal Framework for 1959 Alternate History Roleplay1. Introduction: The Geopolitical and Theoretical Landscape of 1959The year 1959 represents a singular fracture point in military history, a moment where the industrial attrition of the Second World War collided violently with the atomic inevitability of the Cold War. For the purposes of a Nation Roleplay server, specifically one situated in an alternate timeline, this era offers an unparalleled richness of strategic diversity. It is a time when cavalry charges had only just vanished, yet plans for lunar military bases were being seriously drafted. In our timeline, 1959 was the year the United States fully committed to the "Pentomic" nuclear reorganization, the year the Soviet Union solidified its mastery of "Deep Battle" operations, and the year the British government famously declared the manned fighter jet obsolete in the "Sandys Storm" white paper.To facilitate the creation of a "Doctrine Creator" website for roleplayers, this report provides an exhaustive analysis of the military doctrines available during this period. However, it extends beyond mere historical recitation. By integrating the requested "alternate world" elements—specifically Dieselpunk aesthetics, Weird Science, and divergent technological timelines—we can construct a taxonomy of warfare that is both historically grounded and narratively expansive. The objective is to categorize these complex military philosophies into coding-friendly groups, allowing players to construct a national military identity that dictates their force structure, roleplay style, and strategic strengths.The analysis indicates that military doctrine in this era was not simply a choice of weapons, but a choice of national survival strategy dictated by economics, geography, and political ideology.1 A nation does not merely choose Massive Retaliation; it is forced into it by a lack of manpower or a desire to protect a booming civilian economy from the drain of a large standing army.3 Conversely, a nation does not adopt People's War unless it accepts the total mobilization of its civilian population and the yielding of territory.5 This report will dissect these motivations to provide the "flavor text" and "stat modifiers" requisite for a compelling roleplay experience.2. Framework for the Doctrine Creator WebsiteBefore delving into the specific doctrines, it is essential to establish the parameters for the website's "Doctrine Creator" tool. The research suggests that military doctrine is rarely a binary choice but a position on several sliding scales.1 The website should present these variables to the player, with their choices unlocking specific "Doctrine Families."2.1 Core Variables and Coding LogicThe content for the website should be structured around four primary axes, which can be visualized as sliders or multiple-choice questions in the user interface.Axis I: The Lethality Spectrum (Mass vs. Precision)This variable determines whether the nation views war as an industrial process of mass destruction or a surgical application of force.Industrial/Mass: Relies on saturation bombardment, massive conscript armies, and "dumb" munitions. (Unlocks: Deep Battle, Superior Firepower).Precision/Tech: Relies on advanced guidance, elite professional forces, and nuclear/chemical leverage. (Unlocks: Pentomic, Sandys Doctrine, Massive Retaliation).Axis II: The Mobility Spectrum (Static vs. Dynamic)This dictates the operational tempo of the player's roleplay.Static/Positional: Focuses on holding ground, intricate defensive lines, and attrition. (Unlocks: Maginot-style Dieselpunk, Superior Firepower).Dynamic/Maneuver: Focuses on encirclement, speed, and yielding ground to gain advantage. (Unlocks: Mobile Warfare, Deep Battle).Axis III: The Social Integration Spectrum (Professional vs. Total)This defines the relationship between the army and the state, crucial for internal politics RP.Professional/Segregated: The military is a distinct caste or job. Civilians are protected bystanders. (Unlocks: Sandys Doctrine, Mobile Warfare).Total/Integrated: The civilian population is the military. (Unlocks: People's War, Guerre Révolutionnaire).Axis IV: The Exoticism Spectrum (Historical vs. Divergent)Historical: Adheres to real-world 1959 physics and constraints.Divergent: Incorporates "Weird War" elements like biological augmentation, super-heavy landships, or esoteric energy weapons. (Unlocks: Biopunk, Diesel-Juggernaut).72.2 The "Doctrine Card" OutputUpon selecting their parameters, the website should generate a "Doctrine Card" for the player. This card acts as their roleplay bible. It should contain:Doctrine Name: (e.g., "Atomic Cavalier" or "Red Steamroller").Strategic Maxim: A quote defining their philosophy (e.g., "Speed is the essence of war").Force Structure: (e.g., "5-part Pentomic Division" vs "3-part Triangular Division").Preferred Unit: The signature unit they should describe in posts (e.g., "Heavy Hover-Tank" or "Political Commissar").Fatal Flaw: A narrative weakness they must roleplay (e.g., "Logistically fragile" or "Diplomatically inflexible").3. Group A: The Strategic-Nuclear PhylogenyThe Doctrine of the Absolute WeaponThis group encompasses nations that have embraced the nuclear revolution as the primary arbiter of conflict. In the context of 1959, these doctrines are born from a desire to bypass the bloody attrition of conventional warfare through superior technology and existential threats.3.1 Doctrine A-1: Massive Retaliation (The "New Look")Historical Context:This doctrine is derived directly from the Eisenhower administration's "New Look" policy, solidified by NSC 162/2 in 1953.3 Facing the numerically superior Soviet Red Army, the United States concluded it could not match the communist bloc man-for-man without bankrupting its economy. The solution was to slash conventional army budgets and invest heavily in the Strategic Air Command (SAC) and nuclear weapons.3Website Content Description:Philosophy: "More Bang for the Buck." The nation believes that local defenses need only be a "tripwire." If the enemy crosses the line, the response is not a ground battle, but immediate, overwhelming nuclear annihilation of the enemy homeland.3Force Structure: A small, professional ground force acting as a shield, backed by a massive "sword" of long-range bombers (B-52 equivalent) and early ICBMs.Roleplay Mechanics:Diplomacy: Players must engage in "Brinkmanship." Their conventional forces are weak, so they must threaten total war to resolve minor disputes.Weakness: Inflexibility. If a conflict is too small to justify nuking the world (e.g., a colonial rebellion), this nation lacks the tools to fight it effectively.3Alternate World Variant: The Orbital Hegemon. In a timeline where spaceflight accelerated (Sputnik in 1955), this doctrine evolves into "Rod from God" kinetic bombardment platforms, moving the nuclear deterrent entirely into orbit.103.2 Doctrine A-2: The "Sandys" Logic (Technocratic Interdiction)Historical Context:Based on the infamous British 1957 Defence White Paper by Duncan Sandys, this doctrine represents the extreme end of technological optimism. Sandys argued that the speed of modern aircraft rendered dogfighting obsolete, and thus manned fighters should be replaced entirely by guided missiles.11Website Content Description:Philosophy: "The Pilot is Obsolete." War is a mathematical equation solved by guidance systems. The human element is the weak link and should be removed from the "Tip of the Spear".11Force Structure: A total abolition of manned fighter wings in favor of SAM grids (Bloodhound/Thunderbird missiles) and ramjet interceptors. The Army is reduced to a small, air-transportable police force. The Navy scraps battleships for anti-submarine frigates.13Roleplay Mechanics:Aesthetic: Concrete launch pads, radar arrays, and underground control bunkers. The "Push-Button War" aesthetic.Economy: High research costs, low manpower upkeep.Weakness: Electronic Warfare. If the enemy jams the guidance signals, the nation is defenseless, as they have no pilots to fall back on.Alternate World Variant: The Automaton State. Extrapolating the "removal of the human element," this doctrine utilizes remote-controlled drone fleets and rudimentary AI (vacuum tube computers) to fight wars, minimizing citizen casualties to zero.153.3 Doctrine A-3: The Pentomic Division (Nuclear Dispersion)Historical Context:The US Army's specific response to the nuclear battlefield of the late 1950s. General Maxwell Taylor recognized that the concentration of troops required for WWII-style breakthroughs simply created targets for enemy tactical nukes.4Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Dispersion is Survival." To survive on the atomic battlefield, the army must operate as semi-independent "cells" or "battle groups" rather than a cohesive front line.4Force Structure: The "Rule of Five." The division is reorganized from three regiments into five smaller Battle Groups. These units are air-transportable and equipped with their own tactical nuclear weapons (e.g., the Davy Crockett recoilless rifle).4Roleplay Mechanics:Tactics: The "Non-Linear Battlefield." There is no front line. Battle Groups fight in a checkerboard pattern, allowing enemy units to pass between them, only to be destroyed by nuclear crossfire.17Weakness: Logistics. Supplying five independent units that are constantly moving is a nightmare. Players should RP the chaos of command and control.4Alternate World Variant: The Tesla Grid. Instead of nuclear shells, the Battle Groups are equipped with directed energy weapons or "Lightning Guns" (Dieselpunk tech). The dispersion is necessary because the weapons draw power from a broadcast grid, requiring units to act as relay nodes.154. Group B: The Operational-Maneuver PhylogenyThe Doctrine of the Knockout BlowThis group rejects the static attrition of the First World War and the pure nuclear deterrence of the New Look. It focuses on the "Operational Art"—the movement of large formations to induce systemic collapse in the enemy.4.1 Doctrine B-1: Deep Battle (The "Red Steamroller")Historical Context:The Soviet doctrine of Glubokaya operatsiya, perfected by 1959. Unlike Blitzkrieg, which relies on a single narrow breakthrough, Deep Battle emphasizes simultaneous attacks across the entire width and depth of the enemy front to paralyze their response.18Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Catastrophic Systemic Failure." The goal is not to win a battle, but to destroy the enemy's system of defense. By attacking the front, the reserves, and the logistics simultaneously, the enemy is frozen in indecision.20Force Structure:First Echelon: Massive infantry and artillery formations to smash the enemy line.Second Echelon: Tank armies kept in reserve to pass through the breach and rampage in the rear.OMG (Operational Maneuver Groups): Special independent corps designed to raid deep behind lines.18Roleplay Mechanics:Narrative: Descriptions of "endless waves" and the "God of War" (massive artillery barrages). The player should emphasize centralized planning—initiative by lower officers is discouraged if it deviates from the plan.21Stats: High "Organization" and "Reinforcement Rate".22Alternate World Variant: The Subterranean Front. Utilizing "Weird Science" drilling machines (e.g., the Soviet "Battle Mole"), the Deep Battle concept is applied literally under the ground, breaching enemy lines from below.234.2 Doctrine B-2: Mobile Warfare (The "Iron Spearhead")Historical Context:Derived from German Bewegungskrieg and adopted by the budding West German Bundeswehr and Israeli Defense Forces. It is distinct from Deep Battle in its reliance on tactical initiative (Auftragstaktik) and speed.22Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Speed is Armor." The defense is conducted aggressively (Elastic Defense). Rather than holding a line, units retreat to draw the enemy in, then counter-attack the flanks with high-speed armored spearheads.22Force Structure: Combined arms at the lowest level. Tanks, mechanized infantry, and self-propelled guns operate as single units. High ratio of radios and command vehicles.Roleplay Mechanics:Command: Auftragstaktik (Mission Command). Junior officers are given a goal and allowed to achieve it however they see fit. This contrasts sharply with the rigid centralization of Deep Battle.22Weakness: Fuel. These armies are thirsty. A roleplay focus on protecting fuel depots and refineries is essential.25Alternate World Variant: The Grav-Tank Blitz. In a setting with anti-gravity or hover technology (common in 1950s retro-futurism), Mobile Warfare becomes three-dimensional. Rivers and minefields are ignored as hover-tanks glide over obstacles.104.3 Doctrine B-3: The Diesel Juggernaut (Landship Doctrine)Historical Context:This is a purely "Alternate History/Dieselpunk" doctrine, extrapolating from the super-heavy tank designs of late WWII (e.g., the Maus, the Ratte) that were abandoned in our timeline due to air power.7Website Content Description:Philosophy: "The Fortress that Moves." In a world where composite armor or energy shielding advanced faster than shaped-charge missiles, weight is no longer a disadvantage.Force Structure:The Land Battleship: Vehicles weighing 1000+ tons, requiring crews of 50 men.Armored Trains: The logistical spine of the army, heavily weaponized.26Roleplay Mechanics:Aesthetic: Art Deco designs, rivets, black smoke, and raw industrial power. "Decodence" (Deco + Decadence).7Tactics: The "Slow Roll." These forces cannot be stopped by conventional defenses, but they are slow. The enemy can maneuver around them, but cannot hold ground against them.5. Group C: The Firepower-Attrition PhylogenyThe Doctrine of Industrial SlaughterThese doctrines view war as a problem of physics: delivering the maximum amount of explosive energy to a specific coordinate grid.5.1 Doctrine C-1: Superior Firepower (Active Defense)Historical Context:The standard US and Western doctrine prior to the full Pentomic shift. It relies on the wealthy nation's ability to expend ammunition rather than blood.27Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Steel Rain." Never send an infantryman to take a hill if an artillery shell can remove the hill first. The infantry's job is to protect the artillery and mop up survivors.27Force Structure: Triangular divisions with massive organic fire support. Integration of Tactical Air Support (CAS) as "flying artillery".9Roleplay Mechanics:Narrative: "Grid Square Removal." Players should describe logistics trains of trucks carrying millions of shells.Stats: Highest "Soft Attack" and "Hard Attack" values. Low "Movement Speed".24Alternate World Variant: The Automaton Artillery. Use of rudimentary robotics (walking gun platforms) to carry heavy ordnance into difficult terrain.155.2 Doctrine C-2: The Chemical/Biopunk Front (Area Denial)Historical Context:Extrapolating from the 1950s fears of chemical warfare and the "Weird Science" trope of biological experimentation.28Website Content Description:Philosophy: "The Silent Spring." Why destroy the city when you can just remove the population? This doctrine focuses on making the battlefield uninhabitable for the enemy.28Force Structure:Gas Troops: Soldiers in heavy hazmat gear, immune to their own weapons.Biological Assets: Genetically modified organisms or "fungal" area denial agents.28Roleplay Mechanics:Terror: The primary weapon is psychological. The enemy knows that engaging this nation risks a fate worse than death.Diplomacy: The Pariah State. Other nations will likely form coalitions against a Biopunk player due to the indiscriminate nature of their weapons.6. Group D: The Asymmetric-Revolutionary PhylogenyThe Doctrine of the FleaFor nations that lack the industrial base for tanks or the technology for nukes, or for those ideologically driven to weaponize the population itself.6.1 Doctrine D-1: People's War (The Human Sea)Historical Context:Maoist doctrine (Renmin Zhanzheng), codified during the Chinese Civil War and exported in the 1950s.5Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Drowning the Enemy." War is a contest of political will, not military might. By retreating into the countryside and mobilizing the peasantry, the army becomes invisible and ubiquitous.6Force Structure:The Three Forces: Main Forces (regular army), Regional Forces (guerrillas), and Militia (villagers).Political Commissars: Every unit has a political officer to ensure ideological purity and morale.29Roleplay Mechanics:The Three Phases: Players should structure their war narrative in three acts: Strategic Defense (hiding), Strategic Stalemate (harassing), and Strategic Counter-offensive (swarming).6Tactics: "Sparrow Warfare." Small groups appearing and disappearing, inflicting thousands of tiny cuts.30Alternate World Variant: The Psychic Gestalt. In a "Weird Science" setting, the "Human Sea" is literalized through a hive-mind or psychic link that coordinates the militia without radios.316.2 Doctrine D-2: Guerre Révolutionnaire (The Counter-Insurgency State)Historical Context:The French Army's response to People's War, developed in Indochina and Algeria. It is the doctrine of "Total War of the Mind".32Website Content Description:Philosophy: "Pacification through Control." To defeat a revolutionary war, the state must control the population's physical and mental environment. The army becomes the government.32Force Structure:Quadrillage (Grid): The country is divided into sectors, each garrisoned by troops.Air Cavalry: Extensive use of helicopters (new in the 50s) to rapidly deploy paratroopers (Chasseurs) to trouble spots.32PSYOPS: Psychological warfare units are integrated at the platoon level.Roleplay Mechanics:Tone: Dystopian/Authoritarian. Checkpoints, ID cards, and "re-education."Weakness: Political Instability. As seen in the 1958 Algiers putsch, an army that runs the government often decides it is the government.327. The Naval and Aerial DimensionsWhile land doctrine often dominates roleplay, the 1959 setting offers critical divergences in air and sea power that must be coded into the website.7.1 Naval PhilosophiesOption A: The Carrier Strike Group (Blue Water)Basis: US Navy Doctrine.34Content: The Supercarrier is the capital ship. Focus on "Power Projection" (striking land targets) rather than sea control.RP Focus: Massive logistics, multi-national task forces, jet fighters launching from sea.Option B: The Jeune École Redux (Sea Denial)Basis: Soviet Naval Strategy.35Content: "One missile is cheaper than one carrier." Focus on submarines and fast attack craft armed with heavy anti-ship missiles.RP Focus: Asymmetric naval warfare, ambushes, "Bastion" defense of nuclear submarines.Option C: The Submersible Navy (Dieselpunk Variant)Basis: 1957 British White Paper suggestions/Dieselpunk tropes.13Content: Surface ships are obsolete due to nuclear missiles. Everything goes underwater. Submarine aircraft carriers, submarine supply ships, submarine battleships.RP Focus: Sonar duels, crushing depth, the claustrophobia of the "Silent Service."7.2 Aerial PhilosophiesOption A: Strategic Bombing (The Cult of the Offensive)Basis: SAC / RAF Bomber Command.37Content: The war is won by destroying the enemy's will and industry. Fighters are secondary.RP Focus: 24-hour airborne alerts, "Chrome Dome" missions, massive formations of B-52s or Vulcans.Option B: Air Superiority (The Dogfighters)Basis: USAF Tactical Air Command / Israeli Air Force.38Content: Control the air, and the ground war wins itself. Focus on pilot training and high-performance fighters (F-104, MiG-21).RP Focus: The "Ace" culture, fast jets, napalm support for ground troops.8. Data Integration for the Website: Tables and TemplatesTo make the website functional, the descriptive text above must be translated into structured data tables that the "Doctrine Creator" can use to generate outputs.8.1 Comparison Table: Force Structure ModelsDoctrine ModelCommand StructureLogistics LoadTech RelianceKey Unit ExampleRoleplay StrengthMassive RetaliationCentralized (Presidential)Low (Static)High (Nuclear)B-52 StratofortressDeterrence/IntimidationPentomic DivisionDecentralized (Battle Group)Very High (Air Supply)High (Tac-Nukes)Davy Crockett TeamSurvival in Nuke ZonesDeep BattleHighly Centralized (Front)High (Rail/Truck)Medium (Armor)T-55 Tank HordeOverwhelming OffenseMobile WarfareMission Command (Local)Medium (Fuel Heavy)Medium (Radio)Mechanized InfantryTactical FlexibilityPeople's WarPolitical/CellularLow (Scavenging)Low (Small Arms)Militia SaboteurMorale/AttritionDiesel JuggernautHierarchical (Naval style)Extreme (Fuel)High (Metallurgy)1000t LandshipUnstoppable MomentumSandys DoctrineAutomated/NetworkedLow (Missiles)Extreme (Electronics)RAM-Jet MissileAirspace Denial8.2 The "Doctrine Questionnaire" Logic FlowThe website should use a branching logic questionnaire to guide players. Here is the recommended content flow:Question: How does your nation view the apocalypse?Option A: It is inevitable, so we must strike first. -> (Points to Massive Retaliation)Option B: It is survivable, if we disperse. -> (Points to Pentomic)Option C: It is irrelevant; steel wins wars. -> (Points to Deep Battle/Dieselpunk)Question: What is the primary resource of your nation?Option A: Vast manpower. -> (Unlocks: People's War, Deep Battle)Option B: Advanced industrial capacity. -> (Unlocks: Mobile Warfare, Superior Firepower)Option C: Cutting-edge science/electronics. -> (Unlocks: Sandys, Pentomic)Option D: Esoteric/Occult resources. -> (Unlocks: Biopunk, Weird War)Question: Choose your aesthetic.Option A: Chrome, fins, and jets (Retro-Futurism).Option B: Rivets, smoke, and oil (Dieselpunk).Option C: Camouflage, mud, and grit (Realistic Cold War).9. Conclusion and Implementation StrategyBy utilizing this comprehensive framework, the Nation Roleplay server can offer a depth of military customization that goes far beyond simple "Attack/Defense" statistics. The inclusion of the "Pentomic" and "Sandys" doctrines anchors the roleplay in the specific, strange reality of 1959—a time when military planners were genuinely experimenting with nuclear bazookas and pilotless air forces.4Simultaneously, the integration of "Dieselpunk" and "Weird Science" options allows for the creative freedom inherent in an alternate history setting. A conflict between a "Pentomic" player (using dispersed nuclear cells) and a "Diesel Juggernaut" player (using concentrated super-tanks) creates a fascinating asymmetry: The Pentomic player tries to swarm and nuke the giant targets, while the Landship player tries to crush the dispersed cells before they can fire.Recommendations for the GM:Code the Fatal Flaws: Ensure that the "Weaknesses" listed in the doctrine cards have mechanical or narrative consequences. A "Sandys Doctrine" player must be vulnerable to jamming or special forces raids on their missile silos.Encourage Hybridity: Allow players to mix one Land Doctrine with one Aesthetic. A "Dieselpunk People's War" (peasants in powered exoskeletons) is a valid and terrifying concept.Use the 1959 Context: Remind players that this is the dawn of the transistor but the twilight of the tube. Tech should be bulky, unreliable, and prone to overheating. This adds "friction" to the roleplay, making military operations more dramatic and less perfect.
